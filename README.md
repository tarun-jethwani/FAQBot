# DeepLearning for QnA
Contains code in the form of Jupyter/ Ipython Notebook  of sequence to sequence Encoder Decoder Architecture to successfully Answer any Frequently Asked Question by implementing Deep Neural Networks using Pytorch Deep Learning Framework 

This project is created as a variant of another project - Translation with Sequence to Sequence Network using Attension Mechanism using Pytorch found on  https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html, you can visit the link and download the related Ipython notebook and also go thorugh the Tutorial Page and get a thorough Understanding of the underlying implementation. 

However this Project uses a different dataset - Amazon EC2 Instance Common FAQs , I have manually preapared the dataset by seperating the Question and Answer Pair by tab space and putting it line by line, you can have a look in the current repository which contains file ans-que.txt

Also this Project uses Pre-trained Word Embeddings - GloVe Vecotrs, you can download the GloVe Vectors from the following link 
http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip, unzip the folder and keep it in the project directory we have initially used 50 dimensional word vectors
